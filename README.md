# BlenderStruct

BlenderStruct is a Blender add-on that automatically creates a folder structure for your Blender projects and saves the Blender file in the appropriate folder. This add-on is designed to help you stay organized and save time by creating a consistent folder structure for your projects.

> **Warning**
> 
> The Blender file will be saved in the 'project' subfolder within the created folder structure. Ensure that you choose the correct file name and location when using the add-on.

> **Note**
>  Press `Ctrl + Alt + S` to open the file selector.

## Features
